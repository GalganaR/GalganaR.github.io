I am a first year Operations Research PhD student at MIT working with Professor [Negin Golrezaei](https://www.mit.edu/~golrezae/). Prior to MIT, I worked as a Portfolio Implementation analyst at AQR Capital Management. I graduated from Brown University in May 2020 where I studied applied mathematics, computer science, and economics. During my time at Brown, I worked with Professor [Amy Greenwald](http://cs.brown.edu/people/faculty/amy/) in the [E-GLAMOR group](http://glamor.cs.brown.edu/). Contrary to what my profile picture suggests, I am in fact _not_ a purple elephant; you may instead find me at the bottom left of the image. Here is my <a href="files/Rigel_Galgana_CV_8_22_2022.pdf">CV</a>.

Research Interests
======
My interests lie at the intersection of learning, games, and mechanism design. My research focuses on the computational aspects of economic and decision-making problems, such as data driven mechanism design, equilibrium computation, and multi-agent reinforcement learning. I am also interested in the modeling, simulation, and modern applications of games, auctions, and markets. Outside of research, I enjoy playing table tennis, chess, guitar, and piano. Lastly, to those it may concern, I was once the CasualCollective's (RIP) illustrious FroggyX!

Outside of research, I enjoy playing table tennis, chess, guitar, and piano. I also occasionally like to bowl, rock climb, play tennis, and songwrite. I enjoy listening to J-pop and K-pop ballads (LiSA, Inori Minase, Taeyeon, Sam Kim), math rock (Ichika Nito, Manuel Gardner Fernandez), Japanese EDM/Rock (Yunomi, dj-Jo, Amazarashi, Wolpis Kater, Perfume), instrumental covers (Sungha Jung, Animenz, Kyle Landry), and soundtracks (Final Fantasy, NieR: Automata, DEEMO, Tokyo Ghoul, Studio Ghibli).
