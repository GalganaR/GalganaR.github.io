I am an incoming first year Operations Research student at MIT working with Professor [Negin Golrezaei](https://www.mit.edu/~golrezae/). Prior to MIT, I worked as a Portfolio Implementation analyst at AQR Capital Management. I graduated from Brown University in May 2020 where I received a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics-Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics-Economics. Here is my <a href="files/Rigel_Galgana_CV_8_18_2022.pdf">CV</a>.

Interests
======
My research interests lie at the intersection of learning, games, and mechanism design---more specifically data driven mechanism design, equilibrium computation, and multi-agent reinforcement learning. I am also loosely interested in statistical computing, modeling and simulation, and empirical process theory and how they relate to auctions. Outside of research, I enjoy playing table tennis, piano, and guitar.
