I am an incoming Operations Research PhD student at MIT working with Professor [Negin Golrezaei](https://www.mit.edu/~golrezae/). Prior to MIT, I worked as a Portfolio Implementation analyst at AQR Capital Management. I graduated from Brown University in May 2020 where I studied applied mathematics, computer science, and economics. During my time at Brown, I was fortunate to work with Professor [Amy Greenwald](http://cs.brown.edu/people/faculty/amy/). Contrary to what my profile picture suggests, I am in fact _not_ a purple elephant; I am found bottom left. Here is my <a href="files/Rigel_Galgana_CV_8_22_2022.pdf">CV</a>.

Research Interests
======
My interests lie at the intersection of learning, games, and mechanism design---more specifically data driven mechanism design, equilibrium computation, and multi-agent reinforcement learning. I wish to understand the relationship and many parallels between games and machine learning. For example, recent results in this line of research establish the (non) learnability of game outcomes, provide approximation algorithms for auction revenue or welfare maximization, and characterize regret rates under various learning paradigms and environments. At a high level, these topics all assess decision making problems from a computational, rather than purely economic, standpoint. On the flip side, as I believe that much of acclaimed theoretical work is conceived from observing nature, I am also interested in the practical modeling and simulation of games, auctions, and markets.

Hobbies
======
<!-- Outside of research, I enjoy playing table tennis, chess, guitar, and piano. I also occasionally like to bowl, rock climb, play tennis, and songwrite. I enjoy listening to J-pop and K-pop ballads (LiSA, Inori Minase, Taeyeon, Sam Kim), math rock (Ichika Nito, Manuel Gardner Fernandez), Japanese EDM/Rock (Yunomi, dj-Jo, Amazarashi, Wolpis Kater, Perfume), instrumental covers (Sungha Jung, Animenz, Kyle Landry), and soundtracks (Final Fantasy, NieR: Automata, DEEMO, Tokyo Ghoul, Studio Ghibli). Lastly, to those it may concern, I was once the CasualCollective's (RIP) illustrious FroggyX! -->
